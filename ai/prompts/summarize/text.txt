Mukesh Kumar, the Bengal pacer, was handed his Test cap ahead of the second 
match against West Indies on Thursday at the Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain,
Trinidad. Mukesh replaced Shardul Thakur, who BCCI said was not available for
selection due to an injury. "Shardul Thakur was not available for selection for
the 2nd Test due to a sore left groin," BCCI said right after the toss. 
Shardul's injury, however, turned out to be a blessing in disguise for both 
India and Mukesh Kumar. The right-arm pacer had managed to break into the 
Indian Test side even before but didn't get to play a game. This was perhaps 
the last Test where India could get a look at him before their next assignment 
against South Africa five months later.
Who is Mukesh Kumar?
In the 39 first-class matches that he has played so far, Mukesh has picked up 
149 wickets at an impressive average of 21.55.
After playing a key role in taking Bengal to two Ranji Trophy finals in the 
last three seasons, Mukesh found himself in the India A team. There too he 
impressed one and all with five-wicket hauls against New Zealand A and 
Bangladesh A. He has taken 18 wickets at an average of 17.50 for India A.
Mukesh, who was born in Gopalganj, Bihar, made his IPL debut for the Delhi 
Capitals in 2023. In the 10 matches that he played for DC, he picked up 7 
wickets.
He is known to be a workhorse in domestic cricket and someone who can bowl on 
one spot over after over in tough conditions.
"Unfortunately, Shadul has pulled up. He is not fit. Mukesh Kumar will make 
his debut. A very talented guy, who has worked really hard in domestic cricket.
So hopefully, we can get behind him," Rohit said after the toss, which West 
Indies won and opted to bowl first.
Mukesh Kumar not the only debutant in India vs West Indies 2nd Test
Mukesh was not the only debutant in the series-deciding second Test match. 
Spin-bowling al-rounder Kirk McKenzie was handed his Test cap. 
He replaced Raymon Reifer while veteran pacer Shannon Gabriel came into the 
side in place of Rahkeem Cornwall who had had some health issues during the 
series opener.
“Kirk McKenzie makes his debut today, he's ready and raring to go. 
Bowling-wise we were decent. The first game is gone, we got to be mentally 
ready for the challenge. We had a few chats, we got to believe in ourselves,” 
said West Indies captain Brathwaite.
Virat Kohli's 500th match and 100th Test between India and West Indies
This Test match is also a historic one for more reasons than one. It is the 
100th Test match between the two great cricket nations and also marks the 
500th international match for Virat Kohli.
The captains and players of West Indies and India were felicitated ahead of 
the start of the match on Thursday.
“What really makes this rivalry special is the fans. Even if they are not able
to come to watch the matches, they still talk about Test cricket. I haven't 
played here in 12 years and still some of them meet me, remind me about my 
stats and make me feel good,” said India head coach Rahul Dravid.
“It's a historic moment. There is so much history between the two teams. Over 
the years, we have seen some really cricket be it in India or in West Indies. 
I made my debut against them. We hope we can continue the legacy of the former 
players,” said India captain Rohit Sharma.
